#  Scanly - A QR-based Inventory Management System Web Application üåê![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/SnPlQUE.png)

### **The Problem**
Imagine a situation where you are a customer in a retail store. You walk in and inquire about a product's availability. The employee goes to the "back" and takes a long time to return. Once they do, they tell you the bad news of it being unavailable. Both of you just wasted around 10 or so minutes of your life waiting for each other when this process could easily be automated.

### **The Solution**
Scanly seeks for a solution that helps both the customer and the store. It provides the store with an intuitive inventory management system (IMS) powered by QR codes which could then be scanned by customers to view a webpage that gives them all the information they need regarding the product without the need for employee interference.
